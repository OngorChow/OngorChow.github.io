I am going to Australia to have a trip, I would like to make a simple travel plan here.  
 
* **2016/10/29** Chengdu(01:55) to Melbourne(15:20) / Melbourne(19:40) to Sydney(21:05). It would be a tried day, coz we will on the sky all the day. (about 15 hours)  

* **2016/10/30** Travel in Sydney. [University of Sydney](http://www.mafengwo.cn/poi/5423607.html) ／ [Royal Botanic Gardens](http://www.mafengwo.cn/poi/17651.html) ／ [Sydney Opera House](http://www.mafengwo.cn/poi/17113.html) / [Darling Harbour](http://www.mafengwo.cn/poi/35406.html)<br/>
    * *University of Sydney*, we will visit here in the morning, `412、413、 436、 438、439、440、461、480、483` by bus or `m10` by metro to *Parramatta Road* Station. I think we will be here for a few hours. There are some museums in the University, but unfortunately all of them will be closed on Sunday (the day we be there). whatever, I am sure we can still hanging out and having a good time in this famous University.
    * *Royal Botanic Gardens*, our next step is Royal Botanic Gardens, which is a big garden nearby Sydney Opera House. we can take a rest and have some lunch here. `441` by bus to *Art Gallery Of NSW* station, or by metro to *Circular Quay* station. we can walk around here and enjoy the sea view and wind. btw, we can go to [St Mary's Cathedral](http://www.mafengwo.cn/poi/29752.html) take a look too. It is only 300 miles beside the garden. 
    * *Sydney Opera House*, we will spend the dusk time here. It would be a greate view here when the Opera House's lights on.<br/>
    * *Darling Harbour* we will shoping here and buy some food in supermarket for dinner. address: Darling Park station by metro.
    Back to hotel and have dinner. Hope it will be a happy day! :)
